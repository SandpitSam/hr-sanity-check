# HR Sanity Check

This is a small, local-first HR experiment built out of curiosity.

In real HR work, not every manager is looking for guidance or policy interpretation.  
Often, they’re just looking for reassurance — a quick moment to pause and think before acting.

This tool lets people click through common people-management scenarios and reflect on risk, confidence, and next steps.

### What this is
- A lightweight, browser-based demo
- Designed to be explored, clicked, and questioned
- A conversation starter, not a product

### What this is not
- Not legal advice
- Not a decision engine
- Not connected to any system
- No data is collected or stored

### How it works
- Choose a scenario
- Answer a few simple yes/no questions
- Receive high-level, non-prescriptive feedback

All logic runs locally in the browser.

### Why this exists
To explore how simple, thoughtful tools can reduce friction, anxiety, and overthinking in everyday people decisions — without over-automating judgment.

If this sparks ideas, disagreement, or iteration, that’s the point.
